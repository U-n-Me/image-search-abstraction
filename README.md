FCC Image Search Abstraction Project
====================================

This project is being completed using very simple database (lowdb) and using
[pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) free API for image search. As service uses pixabay's image data, so you may not get results for all of your queries.

User Stories
------------
* I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

* I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
* I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
